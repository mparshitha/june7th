1.Java is a source file where a program will be stored in .java, whereas javac is compiler where we compile the java program.

2.JDK-its is a java development kit where we develop a java program, JRE-it ia called as java runtine environment,it means in environmental vurtuals where we creat a path for the program that is java.HOME,JVM- it is called as java virtual machine means we cannot able to see the class of the program it is virtual.

4.Class- it is datatype or non primitive or class
  Object-where we use statement with a refrence variable declaration properties and print the message.
  Signature if the class-

5.Array is used to store and retriev the reference value.

6.java file can be run in JDK and JRE whereas Class file can be run in JVM.

7.6

9.Java is a platform independence because of its byte code and it is object oriented programming language where we have methods,class,functionalities and instances.

10.Variables are  used to stored the data values.
   different types of variables are:
   1.Refrence variable- these are the variables where they point the address of the initialised values in constant pool.
   2.Local variables-these are variable which can return in parameters using paranthisies.

11.Class variable is a non primitive class or a data type.

12.Data types are the non primitive class files.
   types of data types are:
   1.Primitive Datatype-These are byte,short,int,long,float,double,char,boolean. which are used for single number,decimal values,single characters and true or false conditions.
   2.Non primitive Data type-these are implicit or explicit values of class datatype.

13.*Java is platform independence beacuse of its byte code.
   *java is a object oriented language.
   *in java program java file can be run in JDK and JRE.
   *In java program class file can be run in JVM.
   *Java is consists of both primitive as well as non primitive datatypes

16.It is a statement where System is known as pre-defined class name,out is static variable, println is the static method

17.It is used to point the same memory location address of 2 different reference variable in constant pool. from the stack.

18.It is used to access refrence variable values.

19.object class or class Class_name{} 

20.*char. 
   *byte.
   *new.
   *return. 
   *if.
   *else.
   *static.
   *public.
   *void.
   *main.
